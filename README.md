### About:
This project uses pre-trained transformer models to generate questions. The contexts for these are obtained from the lecture content (videos). The contexts extracted are of two types, a) From the speaker (audio) b) From the text content on the video (could be slides). The questions are also then ranked and provided to the user as output.
